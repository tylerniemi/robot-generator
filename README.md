# DA Accelerator Robot Generator
Generate a Rails app that allows a you to track info on robots you'd like to build. *  
Decide what properties of a robot you want to keep track of, and set up the app to let the user create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) robots, stored in a database. If you breezed through this challenge, add extra features to this app (be creative) and tell us what you did so we donâ€™t miss it.
